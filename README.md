# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
## Overview of the Project
This project required us to be able to find the silver tsunami of people who will be retiring soon. This is important as alot of Pewlett Hackards workforce falls within this age range. To ensure the company stays afloat, we need to use SQL to figure out the number of employees retiring. 
This also helps us determine which of the employees can assist with the newer generation in the mentorship program.

## Results
There are around 72,500 employees which meet the Silver Tsunami age criteria and are born between the years of 1952-56. 
Senior positions are taken by 70.2% of the retiring group  
Only 1549 employees fit within the criteria of fulfilling the role of a mentor.
